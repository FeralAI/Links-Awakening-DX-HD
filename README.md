# Links Awakening DX HD

This is an **unaffiliated fork** off [Link's Awakening DX HD](https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd). This fork is more focused on upgrading some of the game visuals that didn't translate to HD very well and making them better in general tho maybe not as faithful. Making the game code a little bit cleaner, updating some of the game components, and fixing some of the bugs that were published that the devs didn't get to fix. 
Check the [wiki](https://github.com/ihm-tswow/Links-Awakening-DX-HD/wiki) for a brief documentation of the in-game tools.

## Improvements

* New Mods menu!
    * Show Extra Dialog: Show/hide the Piece of Power / Guardian Acorn / Heavy Object dialogs that persistently pop up
    * Boost Walk Speed: Set Link's base speed to 1.25x normal speed
* Selectable fonts:
    * Original game font
    * High-readability monospace font (was included in original release, but unused)
* Various Tweaks
    * Enable UI scaling option and allow higher manual max value (same value as "Auto" setting)
